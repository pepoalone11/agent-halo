# Agent Halo Presence Model

The bridge emits raw Letta-native events. The presence model converts those events into a small UI-facing state so desktop and terminal viewers do not each invent their own rules.

## State shape

```ts
type AgentHaloPresenceStatus =
  | "offline"
  | "idle"
  | "thinking"
  | "tool-running"
  | "attention"
  | "closed"
  | "error";
```

The current reducer lives in `packages/protocol/src/presence.ts`.

## Current transitions

| Event | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bridge_ready` | `idle` | Bridge is alive even if no conversation event has arrived yet. |
| `conversation_open` | `idle` | Clears active tool and closed stats. |
| `turn_start` | `thinking` | A user turn entered the model path. |
| `tool_start` | `tool-running` | Captures `activeToolName`; no arguments are stored. |
| `tool_end` | `thinking` / `error` | Clears active tool; errors become error state, success returns to thinking until the next model/turn event. |
| `compact_start` | `tool-running` | Shows context compaction as active work with `activeToolName = compact`. |
| `compact_end` | `thinking` | Records before/after compaction stats and returns to thinking. |
| `llm_start` | `thinking` | A provider request started; records model, message count, and context window. |
| `llm_end` | `closed` / `thinking` / `error` | Records stop reason, duration, token usage, and provider-error summaries; terminal stop reasons close the turn, provider errors enter error state. |
| `attention_requested` | `attention` | An optional PermissionRequest/filtered Notification relay or direct `AskUserQuestion` lifecycle needs user input. It stays until later tool/turn/completion activity resolves it. |
| `turn_complete` / legacy `turn_stop` | `closed` | Local Letta `Stop` hook signal; means the assistant turn finished and should show as done/sticky. |
| `conversation_close` | `closed` | Captures message/tool counts when available. |
| `bridge_error` | `error` | Reserved for bridge/runtime errors. |

## Completion and stale fallback

Letta Code mods now expose `tool_end`, `compact_start` / `compact_end`, and local-backend `llm_start` / `llm_end`; Letta Code 0.27.20 also emits `llm_end` for provider errors with nullable usage and an error summary. Agent Halo still keeps Mahiro's local Letta `Stop` hook via `POST /hook/stop` as a reliable turn-finished fallback because not every backend/surface emits every event. Viewers should still treat long-running `thinking` / `tool-running` states as potentially stale after a local timeout when terminal events are unavailable.

The terminal viewer defaults to `staleAfterMs = 30000`. The desktop uses event-aware missing-terminal fallbacks instead of one universal 30-second timeout: in-flight model work may remain active for up to 10 minutes, tool work for up to 30 minutes, compaction for up to 10 minutes, and transitional events for up to 2 minutes. A paired terminal event still resolves immediately. Once a fallback expires, the desktop maps the quiet event to `inactive`, not `waiting`: only `attention_requested` means the agent actually needs user input. Inactive sessions remain in history but have lower priority than done/idle sessions and do not occupy the notch activity wing.

Legacy persisted or snapshot events whose conversation id is `default` are migrated to the same per-agent fallback identity used by the mod. Scoped `local-conv-*` history is preserved. This prevents events from unrelated projects or stateless subagents from sharing one registry key.

## Derived activity semantics

The desktop UI derives a smaller “activity kind” from raw bridge events for recent-activity rows. The Pet system keeps two independent layers: one user-selected global body projects five broad affect states (`idle`, `working`, `attention`, `done`, `error`), while one shared detached pixel signal maps grouped activity/status truth. Only Halo Bot and Haloform are selectable; Halo Bot remains the fresh/default identity and keeps one separately persisted selection from the complete pinned 10,752-combination Pixabots catalog. Workspace/project hashing and Pet color randomization are disabled. A validated `agent-halo.pet-motion-map` may redirect each semantic state to another body motion, but the true state, status priority, accessibility copy, Keep display awake calculation, and detached Signal V4 remain unchanged. Idle/inactive and bridge/session lifecycle show no signal. This is intentionally a UI derivation, not a new bridge protocol field, and it never invents task content.

Current raw events:

| Raw event | Activity kind | Body state | Signal | Meaning for UI/Pet direction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `turn_start` | `thinking` | `working` | thought | Model turn started; restrained body rhythm plus a semantic thinking signal. |
| `tool_start` + `UpdatePlan` / goal tools | `planning` / `goal` | `working` | flag | Planning/goal work without fake task content. |
| `tool_start` + shell/task/Skill tools | `shell` / `tool` / `skill` | `working` | terminal | Generic execution without exposing arguments/output. |
| `tool_start` + `ApplyPatch` | `editing` | `working` | document/pencil | Code/file edit activity. |
| `tool_start` + `Agent`/`Task` | `delegating` | `working` | branch | Subagent activity without fabricating a durable hierarchy. |
| `tool_start` + `ViewImage` | `visual` | `working` | eye | Visual inspection remains active work. |
| `tool_start` + `memory_apply_patch` / compaction | `memory` / `compact` | `working` | storage | Memory/context work without exposing content. |
| `tool_end` success | derived tool kind | derived status | derived signal | History keeps the latest truthful activity; no fake running claim is added. |
| `llm_start` / `llm_end` | `model` | `working` / derived status | thought | Provider lifecycle; terminal state comes from the actual event result. |
| `attention_requested` / `AskUserQuestion` | `attention` / `asking` | `attention` | question | User input is required; orange state persists until later activity resolves it. |
| `turn_complete` / legacy `turn_stop` / `conversation_close` | `done` | `done` | check | Green one-shot settle while the completed row remains sticky. |
| `bridge_error` | `error` | `error` | X | Red error affect while safe detail stays textual. |
| lifecycle / idle / inactive | `session` / `bridge` | `idle` | none | Identity remains visible without a decorative tail or false activity signal. |

Important limitation: there is no native `plan_start`, `thinking_delta`, or assistant-text event in the current protocol. “Plan” is inferred from the `UpdatePlan` tool, “thinking” is inferred from `turn_start` / `llm_start`, and active work is inferred from tool/model/compaction lifecycle until `llm_end`, `turn_complete`, or inactivity. General approval queue/result state remains unavailable.

Stop/attention hook relays may arrive shortly after a terminal model event. The bridge retains completed scopes for 15 seconds and attaches an unscoped hook only when exactly one recent scope matches the requested cwd/agent constraints; ambiguous same-cwd completions remain unscoped rather than being guessed.

## Privacy stance

The presence model should be enough for ambient UI:

- agent / conversation identity
- cwd / model / permission mode
- current status
- active tool name
- event timestamps

It should not need raw prompts, full tool args, transcript contents, or secrets. Text preview is opt-in at the bridge config level and disabled by default.

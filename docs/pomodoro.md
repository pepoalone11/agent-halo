# Pomodoro contract

Agent Halo includes one local Pomodoro lane inside the desktop app's **Focus** tab. It is independent from Letta bridge/session state, the sibling Stopwatch documented in `stopwatch.md`, and Keep display awake behavior. Pomodoro and Stopwatch may run at the same time without sharing cycle or notification state.

## Cycle

- Focus: 25 minutes by default; customizable from 1–120 minutes
- Short break: 5 minutes by default; customizable from 1–60 minutes
- Long break: 15 minutes by default; customizable from 1–120 minutes
- Long break cadence: every four naturally completed Focus phases by default; customizable from 2–12
- The next phase is prepared but does not auto-start.
- Skipping Focus does not count as a completed Focus session.

## Persistence and reconciliation

Renderer state is stored under `agent-halo.pomodoro`. A running phase stores an absolute `endsAt` Unix timestamp. The UI derives remaining time from `endsAt - Date.now()` on every tick, mount, focus, and visibility change. Reloading, background throttling, or sleeping the Mac therefore does not extend the phase.

Settings are stored separately under `agent-halo.pomodoro-settings`. Each phase snapshots `phaseDurationMs` when it is prepared. Editing settings updates an idle phase immediately, but never changes a running or paused countdown; Restart phase or the next prepared phase uses the new values. **Restart** reloads only the current phase while preserving cycle progress. Confirmed **Reset all** stops the old cycle, returns to idle Focus with zero completed sessions, clears recent completion/Pet state, and preserves custom timer settings. Restoring Defaults remains the separate 25/5/15/every-4 action.

When a deadline has passed, the transition is applied once: completed Focus increments the focus count and prepares Short/Long break; a completed break prepares Focus. Completion remains visible briefly in the notch. A naturally completed Focus may summon the optional **Focus-completion** Pet described in `docs/pet.md`; no other Pomodoro transition summons that purpose. When **Offer movement after Focus** is enabled and selected from it, a local Squat or Overhead Reach Movement Break described in `docs/movement-break.md` may run before the main renderer starts the prepared break. The separate manual companion and its manual Movement lane never mutate Pomodoro.

## Collapsed-notch precedence

1. Agent Attention or Error
2. Active, paused, or recently completed Pomodoro
3. Active or paused Stopwatch
4. Ordinary agent Working or recent Done
5. Idle

This keeps urgent Letta input/errors visible while preserving the user-requested countdown during ordinary agent work. When both Focus tools run, Pomodoro remains the primary countdown and Stopwatch elapsed time becomes secondary right-wing context.

## macOS notifications

Starting a phase explicitly requests Alert permission when needed and immediately schedules one silent non-repeating local notification through `UNUserNotificationCenter`. No sound, badge, critical-alert, or time-sensitive permission is requested. Break completion and Pet-disabled Focus completion use the exact phase deadline. Pet-enabled Focus completion schedules the same request five seconds after the true deadline as a fallback; a successful Pet summon and awaited native cancellation must complete inside a three-second handoff window, while disabled/failed/unavailable Pet delivery leaves the fallback intact.

Pause, Restart, Reset all, and Skip remove the stable `agent-halo.pomodoro` request. Renderer operations are serialized, and the Rust runtime assigns every schedule/cancel a monotonic native revision under one operation lock so stale work from a pre-reload WebView cannot restore an old request. Permission denial or native scheduling failure never blocks the timer; Agent Halo still shows the local completion state. macOS controls actual delivery under Notification settings and Focus modes.

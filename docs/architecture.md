# Agent Halo Architecture

## Goal

Agent Halo is a native presence layer for AI coding agents. It should show what the current agent is doing — conversation lifecycle, model turns, tool usage, and eventually memory/subagent state — without parsing terminal output as the primary source of truth. It currently supports Letta Code (via mod API) and AGY / Antigravity (via hook adapter).

## Why a mod-first bridge

Letta Code has richer runtime state than Claude/Codex hook-only flows: persistent agent identity, conversation identity, scoped cwd/model, tool events, memory, skills, and subagents. A transcript watcher would see some of this late and indirectly. A mod sees public runtime events as they happen.

AGY (Antigravity) uses a different extension model — lifecycle hooks (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PreInvocation`, `PostInvocation`, `Stop`) invoked as shell commands with JSON on stdin/stdout. The AGY adapter translates these hook events into the same `AgentHaloEvent` envelope and posts them to the bridge via `/ingest`, so the desktop UI and presence model work identically regardless of which agent runtime produced the events.

The desktop owns bridge availability, not every bridge process. Every bridge owner and relay normalizes to the canonical IPv4 loopback host `127.0.0.1`, matching the renderer endpoint. At startup it probes the full local `/health` identity. A healthy Letta or standalone owner is reused; an unrelated listener, timeout, or ambiguous connection failure causes a fail-closed occupied state; only an explicitly refused loopback connection starts the bundled standalone bridge. The supervisor retries after an owned crash or external-owner shutdown, while a parent stdio lease and native exit cleanup prevent the desktop-owned child from becoming a permanent daemon. The renderer hydrates `/snapshot` again after SSE reconnect so a bridge that starts after the WebView does not lose capability or recent-event state.

## Boundaries

- Do not import Letta Code internals from the mod, or AGY internals from the adapter.
- Keep bridge state local and explicit.
- Avoid capturing raw user text by default.
- Treat the NDJSON log as local diagnostics, not canonical telemetry.
- Desktop UI should consume the protocol package, not infer fields from mod or adapter implementation details.
- The adapter layer is the only place that knows about AGY-specific hook payloads; the bridge and UI stay provider-agnostic.

## Planned phases

1. **Bridge** — mod emits normalized local events over SSE and NDJSON, including stable per-agent identities for Letta's `default` fallback lanes and short-lived completed-scope correlation for delayed hooks.
2. **Desktop shell** — Tauri or native macOS renderer subscribes to the bridge.
3. **Presence model** — derive stable per-conversation statuses such as idle, thinking, tool-running, attention, inactive, done, and error.
4. **Letta-specific surfaces** — memory dirty/synced, subagent/task activity, skill invocation, permission waits when public mod APIs expose them.


## Presence model

Raw events are normalized into a UI-facing presence model in `packages/protocol/src/presence.ts`. This keeps desktop, terminal, and future menu-bar surfaces aligned on state transitions. See `docs/presence-model.md`.

Optional protocol-v2 runtime identity lets the native desktop map one conversation to its originating Letta host PID. Runtime samples remain a desktop-local read-only concern: the mod and bridge carry PID identity, while macOS `libproc` sampling, CPU deltas, process-tree aggregation, pressure labels, a bounded recent-target window, and strong ended-identity tombstones stay outside the event log. See `docs/runtime-monitor.md`.


## Desktop renderer

`apps/desktop` is the active Notchcode-like renderer. It uses Tauri for an always-on-top transparent macOS surface while the frontend stays protocol-driven React. `src/main.tsx` is the shell/native-window orchestrator; `src/features/session`, `presence`, `setup`, `pomodoro`, `stopwatch`, and `usage` own focused typed behavior, and ordered files under `src/styles/` preserve CSS cascade ownership. The app includes tray controls, selected-monitor-aware native notch metrics and positioning, state-directed session detail, independent local Pomodoro/Stopwatch tools, local usage, and setup without changing the bridge contract. The selected macOS screen is persisted natively by `NSScreenNumber` plus a name/resolution/scale fingerprint; a missing screen falls back to Primary without discarding the saved preference.

The Pet adds one hidden transparent `pet` WebView routed before the main `App` mounts. Schema-v2 summons distinguish `focus-completion`, `manual-companion`, and dismiss-only `setup-preview`; the native window atomically stores the initial summon plus main-renderer projection before show, then retains live projection updates and one bounded action queue. The main renderer remains the sole Pomodoro and notification owner, while Pet is projection-only and mirrors the main-projected body state plus detached Signal V4. Focus completion keeps its Start break/Later/Close notification handoff; a manual companion persists until Hide and offers deliberate Focus navigation and movement without mutating Pomodoro. Both lanes reuse the same surface: a camera-free chooser precedes one explicit Squat or Overhead Reach click, which starts one ephemeral `getUserMedia` stream shared by the mirrored preview and bundled local MediaPipe pose tracker. Exercise-specific counters consume the same landmark result; Focus-completion movement may queue a revalidated prepared-break action, while manual completion returns to the companion. See `docs/pet.md` and `docs/movement-break.md`.

Pomodoro state uses an absolute persisted deadline rather than a decrementing counter, so renderer reload, background throttling, and wake reconciliation do not extend a running session. Duration/cadence settings persist separately; each active or paused phase snapshots its own duration so editing settings cannot make the countdown jump. Starting a phase schedules one silent macOS `UserNotifications` alert natively; pause, reset, and skip cancel it. Renderer operations are serialized locally, while a native monotonic operation gate invalidates stale schedule/cancel work across WebView reloads. Permission or scheduling failure never blocks the local timer. The sibling Stopwatch uses its own persisted wall-clock anchor plus accumulated active duration and a bounded, clearable local history; it never schedules notifications or changes Pomodoro state. In the collapsed notch, agent Attention/Error remains highest priority, then active/recent Pomodoro, then active/paused Stopwatch, then ordinary agent Working/Done activity. If both tools run, Pomodoro stays primary and Stopwatch becomes secondary context. See `docs/pomodoro.md` and `docs/stopwatch.md`.


## Demo mode and visual QA

The desktop frontend supports `?demo=1` plus focused `demoScenario` values so the Notchcode-inspired surface can be inspected without a live Letta bridge. Demo events use the same presence reducer, bounded registry, selectors, components, accessibility behavior, and CSS as live mode.


The desktop app now includes a first tray/menu-bar control plane with Show, Hide, and Quit actions. Agent activity itself does not use OS notifications: the closed notch wing expands persistently for real needs-input activity and briefly for turn completion. Status changes—including Attention, Error, Done, and Pomodoro completion—never auto-open the full panel or activate/focus Agent Halo; full expansion is pointer/keyboard/user-command driven. Hover expansion resizes without taking keyboard focus, while explicit keyboard/click navigation may request focus. Pomodoro completion separately uses an explicitly requested silent local macOS alert. Completed rows remain sticky until explicit Clear, while old incomplete activity becomes low-priority inactive history instead of masquerading as a user wait. Active and Completed sessions share one compact scroll surface; workspace groups expand into child session rows so secondary completions retain detail and terminal-host focus access. Trusted Herdr runtime identity focuses the exact pane through its local socket before activating Ghostty; absent/stale identity falls back to the existing Ghostty cwd/title/session match. The Sessions overview uses dense trusted project/status/activity/model/age anatomy, while selecting a session replaces the overview with a state-directed Working, Needs input, Done, Error, Inactive, or Idle context and a clear Back to sessions control. These views remain event-derived and do not fabricate task prompts, permission diffs, answer controls, or Letta process capabilities. The Tauri installer writes the mod plus an idempotent Stop/PermissionRequest hook relay while preserving existing hooks. The Tauri runtime serializes transparent-window resize/focus intent through `set_panel_open`, and its setup view checks the complete mod/hook install before offering install/reinstall.


## Notchcode visual contract

Mahiro wants Agent Halo to match Notchcode taste for this project, not a generic AI dashboard. The desktop renderer should therefore use a black notch silhouette, pointer/keyboard-expand dropped sheet, compact expandable session rows, session drill-down, completed-session Clear controls, compact setup/status view, small status glyphs, hairline dividers, and restrained state accents. Avoid blue/cyan glass panels, metric grids, large glowing status orbs, and decorative control-room copy unless Mahiro explicitly changes direction.

Concrete parity evidence and known gaps live in `docs/notchcode-parity.md`.

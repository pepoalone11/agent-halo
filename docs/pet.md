# Completion Pet

Production workflow for future identities and Halo Bot loadouts: [`pet-production.md`](pet-production.md).

## Phase 1 contract

Agent Halo uses **Pet** as the product-facing companion concept. The selectable global roster contains only **Halo Bot** and **Haloform**. Halo Bot remains the fresh/default identity and has ten curated user-selectable loadouts; Haloform is the approved provider-derived CRT companion built from a native96 master and explicit semantic masks. Both remain event/state projections rather than persistent desktop-pet simulations.

The Completion Pet is event-only:

- a naturally completed Focus phase may summon one floating Pet;
- Skip, Restart phase, Reset all, Pause, break completion, and app launch do not summon it;
- the Pet appears in a separate transparent Tauri window without activating or focusing Agent Halo;
- clicking the Pet opens transparent radial **Start Short break** (or **Start Long break**), **Later**, and **Close** controls;
- when Movement Break is enabled, those controls offer a camera-free exercise chooser; only a specific **10 Squats** or **10 Overhead Reaches** click may request camera access;
- **Close** and **Later** hide only the current summon;
- Setup owns one global Pet On/Off preference, default On;
- turning Pet Off hides any active summon immediately;
- Setup → Pet persists a floating-only `1×`, `1.5×`, or `2×` size (default `2×`) and can explicitly **Show Pet** without changing Pomodoro or the On/Off preference;
- successful Pet display replaces the completion notification;
- when Pet is disabled or cannot be displayed, the existing silent macOS notification remains the fallback.

## Ownership

The main renderer and `usePomodoro` remain the only Pomodoro state owner. The Pet WebView is projection-only: it never mounts `App`, never runs `usePomodoro`, never writes Pomodoro storage, and never schedules notifications.

```text
main Pomodoro state
  -> native Pet summon projection
  -> hidden/showing Pet WebView
  -> validated Pet action queue
  -> main renderer starts the prepared break
```

The native Pet window stores the latest summon and one bounded pending action. The hidden Pet renderer reads this projection; the main renderer consumes actions and validates that the requested Short/Long break is still idle before starting it. Movement Break reuses this boundary: choosing a specific exercise creates a summon-bound native attempt token, the isolated Pet WebView runs one local camera stream through the shared bundled pose runtime and the selected exercise tracker, and only that current attempt may queue a `movement-complete` action for the main renderer to revalidate. See `docs/movement-break.md`.

## Notification fallback

When Pet is enabled, Focus start schedules the existing silent notification five seconds after the true deadline. A three-second Pet handoff window leaves margin for notification ownership and local window placement before that fallback can fire. At natural completion the main renderer first claims the handoff by awaiting a deadline-checked native cancellation, then attempts one Pet summon:

- cancellation cannot be claimed before the handoff deadline -> keep the original fallback and do not show Pet;
- cancellation succeeds and Pet shows inside the handoff window -> Pet owns completion delivery;
- cancellation succeeds but Pet cannot show or becomes stale -> schedule a fresh near-immediate silent fallback;
- wake/reload reconciliation after the fallback window does not also summon Pet.

This keeps the OS-owned fallback available when the renderer/app is unavailable without delivering both Pet and notification during a normal foreground completion.

## Window and interaction

- The collapsed companion frame remains `116 × 88` logical px. Halo Bot and Haloform use the same square Completion geometry: `1×` renders `39 × 39`, `1.5×` renders `59 × 59`, and `2×` renders `78 × 78`.
- Compact ambient/session delivery remains `30 × 30` / `36 × 36`. Haloform is authored from its tracked native96 source and deterministic delivery strips; Halo Bot preserves the selected loadout.
- The radial-menu frame is `260 × 230` logical px. Three circular actions orbit the Pet on a transparent surface; the dashed orbit and circular controls make the deliberate interaction area visible even without a backing card.
- The frame remains tight because transparent WebViews still have rectangular native hitboxes.
- Default position: 20px from the selected display's visible bottom-right corner.
- Dragging persists a normalized companion anchor with its source display id/fingerprint and clamps to the current visible frame. The current Setup display selection remains authoritative: if it differs from the saved Pet display, Agent Halo applies the normalized anchor on the selected display rather than showing Pet on the old screen.
- The radial action surface grows around the Pet's screen-space center when space permits, clamps fully into the visible frame, and returns to the saved collapsed position when it closes.
- Pet is created and passively shown non-focusable; passive show never calls `set_focus` or application activation.
- A deliberate user click may explicitly make the Pet focusable and focus its controls.
- Setup preview is a separate summon purpose with dismiss-only radial controls. It never queues or starts a break.
- The companion body is the only drag surface; controls opt out.
- Reduced motion holds the existing final Done/check frames without sprite playback.

## Preference migration

The preference key is `agent-halo.pet`. When absent, Agent Halo reads the legacy `agent-halo.mascot` value and writes the normalized Pet preference. Fresh installs default to Halo Bot. Only `halo-bot` and `haloform` are valid; retired, unknown, or malformed stored values normalize and rewrite to Halo Bot. Halo Bot's independent `agent-halo.halo-bot-loadout` key accepts only `3051`, `1462`, `5324`, `c160`, `2515`, `4232`, `d351`, `6124`, `9132`, or `f061` and defaults to `3051`. The loadout is global, user-selected, and never project-hashed or randomized. Product UI, accessibility copy, types, and settings use **Pet**.

`agent-halo.pet-motion-map` stores one validated presentation mapping from each truthful Letta body state (`idle`, `working`, `attention`, `done`, `error`) to one of those five motion families. The default mapping is identity. Changing the mapping affects only the body strip and playback—for example, `working → idle` keeps semantic `data-state="working"`, Working copy/status precedence, Keep display awake behavior, and the independent Signal V4 activity icon unchanged.

## Global Halo Bot

Halo Bot uses the MIT Pixabots layered character system pinned in the tracked asset provenance. One four-part rig composes face/eyes, head shell, body/outfit, and top accessory; Agent Halo preserves the authored palettes and adds deterministic layered `idle`, `working`, `attention`, `done`, and `error` motion. The ten approved loadouts share that motion contract while remaining one persisted Pet identity. Signal V4 stays a detached semantic layer and is never baked into the body strips.

## Global Haloform

Haloform is one global identity across ambient, session, group, detail, Setup, and real Completion Pet surfaces:

- the source is one hash-bound standalone provider image normalized to an approved `96 × 96` canonical master; it is not claimed as provider-native 96px art;
- explicit body/head/face/top masks and reconstructed hidden surfaces make deterministic integer-offset motion possible without changing the neutral canonical image;
- tracked strips deliver `30 × 30` ambient, `36 × 36` session/detail, and `96 × 96` Completion source cells for Idle, Working, Attention, Done, and Error;
- Signal V4 remains an independent truthful semantic layer and is never baked into the body strips;
- provenance, masks, QA, approval receipt, and deterministic builder live at `apps/desktop/assets/mascots/agent-halo-roster/source/haloform-motion-v1/`.

## Verification

- Pet route does not mount main Pomodoro/session/bridge ownership.
- Natural Focus completion summons exactly once; non-natural transitions do not.
- Start break action is validated and consumed exactly once by main.
- `×`, Not now, disable, and show failure leave no invisible hitbox.
- Passive show preserves the current macOS foreground app and keyboard focus.
- Drag/restore/clamp passes on the selected display, Retina coordinates, and disconnected-display fallback.
- Release evidence must cover browser state/action/accessibility tests, Rust position/state tests, performance budgets, release install/restart, installed-binary equality, and a native foreground smoke; each promotion reports this evidence explicitly rather than treating the Phase 1 contract as a blanket PASS.

# Performance baselines

Agent Halo treats performance claims as local regression evidence, not universal guarantees. Measure on the same machine, with the same deterministic workloads, and compare medians/p95 rather than one run.

## Baseline

Baseline commit: `4a5c0f1` (`feat: ✨ add state-directed sessions and Soft Cube mascot`).

| Surface | Baseline |
| --- | ---: |
| Desktop CSS gzip | 7,579 bytes |
| Desktop JavaScript gzip | 78,838 bytes |
| Desktop `dist/` | 573,055 bytes / 44 files |
| Legacy session-cat runtime | 245,616 bytes / 15 files |
| Production demo ready p50 / p95 | 30.3ms / 41.6ms |
| Post-DOM render-ready p50 / p95 | 9.5ms / 12.1ms |
| Native RSS observation | 37,632 KiB median |
| Live snapshot | 500 events / 271,820 bytes; 0.89ms p50 / 2.97ms p95 |

The browser/native timings above are bounded observations from Mahiro's Mac. They include local WebKit/Chrome state and are not CI budgets.

## Refactor workloads and budgets

The revision entries below are historical measurement/provenance records, not the canonical behavior contract. Current Pet/Movement behavior is owned by the schema-v2 TypeScript/Rust types and state/actions, with `docs/pet.md` and `docs/movement-break.md` as active contract owners.

`pnpm test:performance` builds the desktop and checks three evidence layers:

1. **Bundle budget** — no regression beyond the baseline CSS/dist sizes, a small JavaScript cushion, and no legacy session-cat files in `dist/`.
2. **Session model** — deterministic 3,200-existing + 500-incoming event merge across 100 conversations, summary derivation, and 1,000-session workspace grouping.
3. **Bridge** — temporary-`HOME` mod startup and 5,000-event publication with bounded startup/throughput and a real temporary NDJSON log.

The initial registry-native refactor measured:

| Operation | Before p95 | After p95 | Change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Merge 500 events | 4.3ms | 1.4ms | −67.4% |
| Derive summaries | 0.30ms | 0.20ms | −33.3% |
| Group 1,000 sessions | 2.1ms | 0.9ms | −57.1% |

The `pomodoro-custom-v1` budget revision intentionally raises the primary bundle ceilings to 8,300 bytes CSS gzip and 89,000 bytes JavaScript gzip. The feature adds a persisted deadline/settings state machine, compact timer and custom-settings UI, collapsed-notch countdown, and native-notification orchestration; its final measured candidate build is 8,153 bytes CSS gzip and 87,262 bytes JavaScript gzip. The total `dist/` ceiling remains unchanged at 573,055 bytes, and legacy session-cat assets remain forbidden. This is an explicit product-feature allowance rather than an unreviewed regression.

The `runtime-monitor-v2` revision keeps those ceilings at 8,750 bytes CSS gzip and 91,000 bytes JavaScript gzip while adding automatic ended-identity cleanup, bounded recent-target selection, stale-sample guards, and accessible hidden-row feedback. Its measured candidate is 8,719 bytes CSS gzip and 90,846 bytes JavaScript gzip. The compact read-only Runtime tab still includes PID-aware event plumbing, pressure classification, native polling state, and browser-demo evidence; native `libproc` code remains outside the web bundle. The total `dist/` ceiling remains 573,055 bytes and legacy session-cat assets remain forbidden.

The `focus-stability-v1` revision keeps the CSS ceiling at 8,750 bytes and raises JavaScript gzip to 92,000 bytes for serialized native panel resize/focus intent, passive-hover focus protection, and status/Pomodoro focus-regression coverage. Its measured candidate is 8,719 bytes CSS gzip and 90,975 bytes JavaScript gzip. The total `dist/` and legacy-asset constraints remain unchanged.

The `runtime-palette-v1` revision raises CSS gzip to 8,900 bytes while keeping JavaScript at 92,000 bytes. It adds a semantic Runtime pressure hierarchy—green Normal, hollow amber Elevated, solid amber High, red Critical, and hollow dashed neutral Unavailable—plus inner-left alignment for the Pomodoro phase wing. Its measured candidate is 8,793 bytes CSS gzip and 90,984 bytes JavaScript gzip. The total `dist/` and legacy-asset constraints remain unchanged.

The `completion-pet-v1` revision raises CSS gzip to 9,300 bytes and JavaScript gzip to 95,000 bytes for the separate projection-only Pet surface, radial action menu, preference migration/toggle, and delayed notification-fallback orchestration. Its measured candidate is 9,234 bytes CSS gzip and 93,282 bytes JavaScript gzip. The main renderer remains the sole Pomodoro owner; the Pet route does not mount bridge/session/timer ownership. The total `dist/` and legacy-asset constraints remain unchanged.

The `completion-pet-controls-v2` revision raises CSS gzip to 10,500 bytes and JavaScript gzip to 97,000 bytes for the user-approved transparent 2× Pet, orbit-centered liquid squash/stretch reveal motion, pure-black borderless/shadowless smaller radial controls with larger icons, native-resize position compensation, three-section Setup sidebar, persisted floating-size controls, stateful Show-again/Update-Pet preview UX, and distinct Restart/Reset-progress Pomodoro controls. Its measured candidate is 10,235 bytes CSS gzip and 95,152 bytes JavaScript gzip. The main renderer still exclusively owns Pomodoro state and notification work; preview remains projection-only and cannot queue a break. The total `dist/` and legacy-asset constraints remain unchanged.

The `movement-break-phase-1-code-split` revision keeps the primary ceilings at 10,500 bytes CSS gzip, 97,000 bytes JavaScript gzip, and 573,055 bytes core `dist/`. The explicitly user-triggered pose tracker is code-split and has a separate 28,250,000-byte offline runtime/model ceiling; its measured local payload is 28,192,416 bytes. This covers pinned MediaPipe WASM plus the hash-verified Pose Landmarker Lite model shared by Squat and Overhead Reach tracking and avoids any runtime CDN/model request.

The `halo-bot-main-pet` revision raises the primary CSS ceiling to 10,800 bytes and core `dist/` ceiling to 575,500 bytes for the accessible ten-loadout Setup disclosure, independent persisted loadout contract, square Completion Pet geometry, and explicit native summon validation. Halo Bot's 50 compact body strips are accounted separately under a 50,000-byte runtime-asset ceiling instead of being hidden inside the core allowance; the promoted set measures 49,730 bytes. JavaScript remains capped at 97,000 bytes and the MediaPipe movement-runtime ceiling remains unchanged.

The `complete-pixabots-catalog` revision replaces those 50 curated state strips with the complete pinned 43-part layered source catalog. This exposes all 10,752 valid combinations without generating 53,760 body-strip files; the exact promoted PNG payload is 42,182 bytes and remains inside the existing 50,000-byte Halo Bot asset ceiling. JavaScript/CSS changes cover bounded base36 validation, four compact selectors, layered composition, and deterministic state motion. After restoring Pixabots' original eight-frame per-layer Idle bounce, 16-tick eye playback, and approved three-phase per-layer Working rig, the measured candidate is 13,549 bytes CSS gzip and 105,401 bytes JavaScript gzip, so their explicit ceilings become 13,650 and 105,500 bytes respectively; core dist, Halo Bot, Haloform, movement-runtime, and legacy-asset constraints remain unchanged.

The `inactive-group-removal` revision keeps the primary CSS ceiling at 11,100 bytes and raises JavaScript gzip from 97,000 to 97,300 bytes for guarded whole-group history removal. The `3fc8ff8` base measured 96,822 bytes JavaScript gzip; the exact-membership confirmation, atomic registry cleanup, and per-child tombstones measure 97,138 bytes in the final candidate. Core `dist/`, mascot, movement-runtime, and legacy-asset constraints remain unchanged.

The `usage-insights-v1` revision raises the primary CSS ceiling to 11,300 bytes and JavaScript gzip ceiling to 97,600 bytes. The allowance covers the compact local-history continuation: truthful update/stale timing, accessible trend summary, semantic daily disclosure, and narrow layout fallback. It does not relax the core `dist/`, mascot, movement-runtime, or legacy-asset constraints.

The `usage-cache-hydration` revision raises JavaScript gzip to 97,800 bytes for versioned persisted usage snapshots. On reload, the renderer hydrates a last-good snapshot immediately as explicitly outdated while the normal provider refresh remains in the background; the cache contains only provider display snapshots, never credentials or raw exports.

The `usage-codex-reset-details` revision raises the CSS gzip ceiling to 11,350 bytes for the compact Codex `Rate Limit Resets` and `Credits` value rows. These rows restore the measured reset-credit contract from the provider snapshot without adding claim actions or expiry timelines to Agent Halo's read-only Usage surface.

The `usage-native-background-v1` revision keeps the cache-first renderer behavior while dispatching the blocking Codex, Antigravity, Claude, and Cursor provider commands through Tauri's blocking worker pool. Provider refreshes may still run concurrently, but HTTP, language-server, SQLite, and `ccusage` work no longer executes on the renderer invoke path.

The `services-top-level-web-evidence-v1` revision replaces the temporary internal Runtime tabs with the approved canonical top-level Services header tab. It lowers the CSS gzip ceiling from 11,600 to 11,500 bytes after removing the invented hairline-tab styles and keeps JavaScript gzip capped at 98,000 bytes while adding the main-tab route plus independently scoped Runtime/Services polling. The budget script measures the candidate at 11,430 bytes CSS gzip and 97,835 bytes JavaScript gzip. Native bounded browser-app evidence and the explicit PID/start/address/port registry remain outside the web bundle.

The `services-owner-evidence-v1` revision raises JavaScript gzip from 98,000 to 98,500 bytes while keeping CSS at 11,500 bytes. The allowance covers safe HTTP document titles, current service-cwd context, bounded owner-target transport, compact `Started by Letta · project · Herdr pane` rows, and the disjoint Web frontend / Letta service / Other listener hierarchy; native ancestry matching remains outside the web bundle. The candidate measures 11,479 bytes CSS gzip and 98,119 bytes JavaScript gzip. It never ships command arguments, response bodies, terminal output, or environment values to the renderer.

The `stopwatch-history-v1` revision raises the primary CSS gzip ceiling to 12,200 bytes and JavaScript gzip to 101,000 bytes for the independent reload-safe Stopwatch state machine, bounded validated local history, Focus sub-navigation, keyboard semantics, destructive confirmations, and concurrent collapsed-notch context. The measured candidate is 12,075 bytes CSS gzip and 100,562 bytes JavaScript gzip. Stopwatch remains renderer-local: it adds no native command, notification, Keep display awake, or Pomodoro/Pet ownership.

The `movement-exercises-v2` revision raises the primary CSS gzip ceiling from 12,200 to 12,250 bytes while keeping JavaScript gzip at 101,000 bytes. The 50-byte allowance covers the camera-free two-exercise Pet chooser and exercise-specific progress labels for Squat and Overhead Reach; the shared camera, bundled MediaPipe runtime/model ceiling, native attempt token, and Pomodoro action contract remain unchanged. The candidate measures 12,206 bytes CSS gzip and 100,678 bytes JavaScript gzip.

The `services-process-control-v1` revision raises the primary CSS gzip ceiling from 12,250 to 12,500 bytes and JavaScript gzip from 101,000 to 101,750 bytes. The bounded allowance covers one-at-a-time service disclosures, native process detail presentation, accessible Stop/Force kill confirmations and result states, plus process-identity-aware renderer coordination. The measured candidate is 12,402 bytes CSS gzip and 101,658 bytes JavaScript gzip. PID/start/UID/endpoint revalidation, signaling, protected-process policy, and capability expiry remain native and do not enter the web bundle; command arguments and environment values remain excluded.

The `interactive-pet-v2` revision raises the primary CSS gzip ceiling from 12,500 to 12,750 bytes and JavaScript gzip from 101,750 to 104,500 bytes. The bounded allowance covers the third Focus `Move` tool, schema-v2 purpose/projection synchronization, manual companion radial actions, exact-exercise launch handoff, and replay-safe Done-to-current-state choreography while reusing the existing five body motions, Signal V4, and code-split pose runtime. The final measured candidate is 12,668 bytes CSS gzip and 104,319 bytes JavaScript gzip after the narrow-tab, launch-feedback, atomic-first-frame, and dismissal-ownership corrections. Core `dist/`, mascot, MediaPipe runtime, local-camera privacy, and legacy-asset constraints remain unchanged.

The low-risk bridge refactor's three-run median measured event duration `603.06ms → 574.18ms` (−4.79%) and throughput `33,164 → 34,832 events/s` (+5.03%) for 20,000 deterministic events. Startup stayed effectively flat; synchronous NDJSON durability and event ordering remain unchanged.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm benchmark:sessions
pnpm benchmark:bridge
pnpm test:performance

# Explicit bridge comparison against a Git ref
node scripts/benchmark-bridge.mjs --ref=HEAD --events=20000
```

Higher-risk work such as asynchronous/buffered NDJSON writes, log rotation, and replacing localStorage with a different persistence engine requires a separate durability/retention decision. Do not trade away event order or crash/reload recovery for a synthetic throughput win.
